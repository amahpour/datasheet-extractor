  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a detailed electronic datasheet for a device that measures DC voltage and current. The device is designed to measure DC voltage at 2V and DC current at 5V, with the ability to load up to 2.5 AC. The device is capable of measuring both AC and DC currents simultaneously. The datasheet includes a graph showing the relationship between DC voltage and current for different loads, as well as an explanation of how to use the device.",
