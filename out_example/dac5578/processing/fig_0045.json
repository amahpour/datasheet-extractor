  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a graph with two lines, one representing the external reference and the other indicating the current temperature of a power supply. The graph is set against a black background, making it easy to read and understand. The x-axis displays the reference value in millivolts (mV), while the y-axis represents the current temperature in degrees Celsius (°C). The lines on the graph show that there's a significant difference between the external reference and the actual temperature of the power supply, with the reference being higher than the current temperature.",
