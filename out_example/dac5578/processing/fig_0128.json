The graph shows a range of temperatures over time, with the highest point being at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) and the lowest point being at 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit). The graph also includes labels for each temperature value and a legend to identify the different temperature intervals.",
