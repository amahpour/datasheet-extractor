The diagram shows the sensor's output at different time intervals, ranging from 0 to 5 seconds. There are three peaks on the graph, each representing a specific time point during the measurement process. The text \"From Code 400h to Cs = 2.5 V\" is also present in the image, indicating that the sensor was used for measuring an external reference voltage of 2.5V over a period of 4 hours.",
