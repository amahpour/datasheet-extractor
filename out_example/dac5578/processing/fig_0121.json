The graph is labeled \"DIFFERENTIAL LINARITY ERROR vs Temperature (DAC5578 8-bit)\" in black text at the top of the image. The x-axis shows the temperature values from 0 to 100 degrees Celsius, while the y-axis represents the external reference and its corresponding value. The graph displays two lines: one representing the external reference and the other representing the temperature.",
