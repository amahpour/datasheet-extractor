  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a graph with the x-axis labeled \"Digital input code\" and the y-axis labeled \"Linear error\". The graph displays the relationship between digital input code (DAC) and linear error, with DAC values ranging from 0 to 6. The graph shows that as the DAC value increases, the linear error also increases linearly. This suggests a positive correlation between DAC and linear error in the electronic system being measured.",
