The graph shows that the temperature is relatively low, as indicated by the blue line on the graph. The x-axis of the graph displays values from 0 to 5, while the y-axis represents the temperature in degrees Celsius.\n\nThe text \"External Reference = V\" and \"Figure 28\" are also present in the image, providing additional information about the data being presented.",
