  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a detailed black and white diagram of an electronic circuit, specifically focusing on the components of a digital clock. The circuit is divided into two parallel lines, each representing a different component or function within the clock. On one side, there are three vertical lines that symbolize the three main components of a digital clock: the hours, minutes, and seconds. These lines are connected to a horizontal line below them, which represents the timekeeping mechanism of the clock. The diagram also includes labels for each component, such as \"SDA\", \"SLA\", \"P\", \"RCL\", and \"CONDITION\".",
