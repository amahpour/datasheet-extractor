The graph displays four lines, each representing a different temperature range in degrees Celsius. The first line represents 0 to 2.5V, the second line represents 2.5 to 5V, the third line represents 5 to 10V, and the fourth line represents 10 to 25V. The graph also includes text that reads \"Gain error vs Temperature\" and \"External reference = 2.5V\".",
