The x-axis of the graph is labeled \"External Reference\", while the y-axis is labeled \"Temperature (DAC57)\". The graph shows that the external reference is 2.5V, and the temperature is 10-bit. The two lines on the graph are parallel to each other, indicating a consistent relationship between the external reference and the temperature.\n\nThe text at the bottom of the image reads \"Figure 80.\" This may be a title or description for the data presented in the graph.",
