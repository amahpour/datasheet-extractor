The box is outlined in black against a white background, providing a clear contrast for easy visualization. Inside the box, there are two small holes on the sides, likely serving as ventilation points or for attaching items to be packed.\n\nThe diagram also includes text that reads \"Tape and Reel Box Dimensions\", indicating the dimensions of the box in both length and width. The text is positioned at the top left corner of the image, while the rest of the diagram is centered below it.",
