The image presents a graph that displays the relationship between voltage and current in a DC circuit, specifically focusing on the source current at a positive rail. The x-axis of the graph represents the voltage, while the y-axis represents the current. The graph shows a downward slope from left to right, indicating an increase in current as the voltage increases. The source current is represented by a blue line that starts at 2.5V and ends at 2.75V on the x-axis.
