The image presents a graph with the x-axis labeled "Digital input code" and the y-axis labeled "Differential linearity error". The graph displays the relationship between the digital input code (DAC) and the differential linearity error, represented by a line on the graph. The line slopes upwards from left to right, indicating that as DAC increases, so does the linearity error.
