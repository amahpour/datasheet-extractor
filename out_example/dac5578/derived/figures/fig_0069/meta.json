        "text": "The image presents a graph of an electrical circuit, with the x-axis representing time and the y-axis indicating voltage. The graph displays two lines on the same page, one labeled \"clock feedthrough\" and the other labeled \"clock feedthrough impuse\". These lines are connected by a line segment, suggesting that they are part of the same circuit. The graph also includes text that provides information about the circuit's operation, including the voltage and current values at different points in time.\n\nThe image is predominantly black and white, with the exception of the two lines on the graph. The x-axis is labeled \"time\" and the y-axis is labeled \"voltage\", providing a clear representation of the relationship between these two variables.",
