The image presents a black and white diagram of a power-off glitch, which is a type of electrical interference that occurs when two or more AC waves interfere with each other, resulting in a fluctuating pattern of voltage across the system. The diagram shows three different AC waveforms labeled "DAC = 0.1 mV", "DAC = 1 mV", and "DAC = 2 mV". These waveforms are represented by vertical lines on the graph, indicating their respective amplitudes or voltages. The diagram also includes a legend that explains the meaning of each line representing an AC waveform.
