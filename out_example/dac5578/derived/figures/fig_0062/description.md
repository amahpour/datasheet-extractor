The image presents a black and white diagram of a sensor's output, which is displayed in a graph format. The x-axis represents time, while the y-axis shows the voltage or current. The graph displays a rise and fall pattern over time, indicating the sensor's response to an input signal. The text at the bottom of the image provides information about the sensor's functionality and its ability to measure voltage or current.
