The image presents a graph with two lines, one representing the DC current and the other representing the AC voltage. The DC current line is at 0V on the x-axis and goes up to 1.5V on the y-axis, while the AC voltage line is at 0V on the x-axis and also goes up to 1.5V on the y-axis. The graph shows that both the DC current and AC voltage are at their maximum values, indicating a stable electrical system.
