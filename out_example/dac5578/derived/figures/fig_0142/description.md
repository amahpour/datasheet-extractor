The image presents a graph that displays the power supply current of a device over time, with the x-axis representing time and the y-axis representing the current in amperes (A). The graph shows a series of blue bars, each corresponding to a specific time period, indicating the change in current over time. The graph is labeled "Power Supply Current Histogram" at the top, and it also includes a legend that explains what each bar represents.
