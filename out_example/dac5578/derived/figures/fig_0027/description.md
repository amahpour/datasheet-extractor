The image presents a graph that displays the relationship between linearity error and digital input code (DAC) for various channels. The x-axis of the graph represents DAC, while the y-axis shows linearity error in bits. The graph is divided into six distinct channels, each with its own line representing the relationship between DAC and linearity error. The graph also includes a legend that provides information about the channels represented on the graph.
