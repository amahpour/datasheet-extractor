The image presents a graph that displays the relationship between voltage and current in a circuit, with the x-axis representing voltage and the y-axis representing current. The graph shows a downward trend, indicating that as the voltage increases, the current decreases. There is also a line of best fit on the graph, which suggests an equation to describe this relationship. The text "Source Current at Positive Rail" indicates that the source current is being measured in milliampere-volts (mA) when the circuit operates at positive rail conditions.

The image includes a title and labels for clarity, but does not provide any additional information about the specific components or materials used in the circuit.
