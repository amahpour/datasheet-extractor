The image presents a graph with the x-axis labeled "Digital input code" and the y-axis labeled "Linear error". The graph displays the relationship between digital input code (DAC) and linear error, with DAC values ranging from 0 to 6. The graph shows that as the DAC value increases, the linear error also increases linearly. This suggests a positive correlation between DAC and linear error in the electronic system being measured.
