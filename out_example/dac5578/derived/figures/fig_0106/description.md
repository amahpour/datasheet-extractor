The image presents a graph with the x-axis labeled "Digital input code" and the y-axis labeled "Differential linearity error". The graph displays the relationship between the digital input code (DIC) and the differential linearity error (DLER). The graph shows that as the DIC increases, the DLER also increases. There are five different channels shown on the graph with varying DIC values.
