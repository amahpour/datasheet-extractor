The image presents a line graph that displays the supply current of a particular electronic component over time, with each point on the graph representing a specific moment in time. The x-axis of the graph is labeled "Time" and the y-axis is labeled "Supply Current (mA)". The graph shows a gradual increase in supply current from left to right, indicating that the component's performance has improved over time.
