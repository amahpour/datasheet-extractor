The image presents a black and white diagram of a DC ac output noise measurement, with the x-axis representing time in seconds (s) and the y-axis representing voltage in volts (V). The graph shows a fluctuating pattern of peaks and valleys, indicating the varying levels of noise over time. A text box is present at the bottom right corner of the image, providing information about the DC ac output noise measurement.
