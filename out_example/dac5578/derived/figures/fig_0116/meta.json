        "text": "The image presents a graph with two lines, one representing the linearity error and the other showing the temperature of the device. The x-axis displays the reference value for the external reference, while the y-axis represents the temperature in degrees Celsius (°C). The graph shows that the linearity error is relatively low at around 1.0e-3, indicating a good level of accuracy in the measurement. On the other hand, the temperature of the device is shown as 2.5°C, which might be too high for optimal performance or could indicate an overheating issue.",
