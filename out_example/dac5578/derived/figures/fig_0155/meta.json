        "text": "The image presents a black and white diagram that illustrates the external reference of a clock feed-through (LDCF) circuit, with two input channels labeled \"Volt\" and \"Time\". The diagram also includes a reference to a trigger pulse, which is represented by the number 5 in the diagram.\n\nIn addition to these elements, there are several text boxes providing information about the circuit's operation. These include details such as the external reference (2.5 mV/s), the clock feed-through (LDCF), and the trigger pulse (5 V). The diagram also includes a time scale of \"Time\" (2 us/div) to indicate that the values are measured in microseconds.",
