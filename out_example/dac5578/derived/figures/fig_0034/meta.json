        "text": "The image presents a graph with the x-axis labeled \"Digital input code\" and the y-axis labeled \"Linearity error\". The graph displays the relationship between digital input code (DAC) and linearity errors, with DAC values ranging from 0 to 40 bits. The graph shows that as DAC increases, so does the linearity error. This suggests a tradeoff in accuracy for increased precision when processing digital signals.",
