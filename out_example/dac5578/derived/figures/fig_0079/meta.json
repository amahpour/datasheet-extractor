        "text": "The image presents a graph that displays the Glitch Energy of a device, which is measured in 5V and 12bit. The device's energy consumption can be seen as a function of time, with the x-axis representing time (in hours) and the y-axis representing energy consumed (in units). The graph shows a falling edge at the top right corner, indicating that the energy consumption has been decreasing over time.",
