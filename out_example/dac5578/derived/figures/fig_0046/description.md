# fig_0046

The image presents a graph with two lines, one representing the external reference voltage (V) and the other representing the temperature in degrees Celsius (°C). The graph shows that the temperature is relatively low, as indicated by the blue line on the graph. The x-axis of the graph displays values from 0 to 5, while the y-axis represents the temperature in degrees Celsius.

The text "External Reference = V" and "Figure 28" are also present in the image, providing additional information about the data being presented.
