The image presents a graph with two lines, one representing the differential linearity error and the other showing the digital input code (DAC) for a digital signal processing system. The graph displays the relationship between the channels shown on the external reference and the DAC values. The x-axis of the graph is labeled "External Reference", while the y-axis is labeled "Digital Input Code". The graph shows that all eight channels are shown, with the DAC values ranging from 0 to 12 bits.
