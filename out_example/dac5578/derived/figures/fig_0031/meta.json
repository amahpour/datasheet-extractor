        "text": "The image presents a graph with two lines, one representing the differential linearity error and the other showing the digital input code (DAC) for a digital signal processing system. The graph displays the relationship between the channels shown on the external reference and the DAC values. The x-axis of the graph is labeled \"External Reference\", while the y-axis is labeled \"Digital Input Code\". The graph shows that all eight channels are shown, with the DAC values ranging from 0 to 12 bits.",
