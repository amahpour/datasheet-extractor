The image presents a line graph that displays the relationship between digital input code (DAC) and linear error. The x-axis of the graph represents DAC, while the y-axis shows the linear error in 10 bits. The graph is color-coded to indicate different channels, with each channel represented by a distinct color. The graph also includes text providing information about the relationship between DAC and linear error.
