The image presents a graph with the x-axis labeled "Digital input code" and the y-axis labeled "Linearity error". The graph displays the relationship between digital input code (DAC) and linearity errors, with DAC values ranging from 0 to 12 bits. The graph shows that as DAC increases, the likelihood of a linearity error also increases.
