# fig_0117

The image presents a graph with two lines, one representing the linear error and the other representing the temperature. The x-axis of the graph is labeled "External Reference", while the y-axis is labeled "Temperature (DAC57)". The graph shows that the external reference is 2.5V, and the temperature is 10-bit. The two lines on the graph are parallel to each other, indicating a consistent relationship between the external reference and the temperature.

The text at the bottom of the image reads "Figure 80." This may be a title or description for the data presented in the graph.
