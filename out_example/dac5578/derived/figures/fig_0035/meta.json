The graph displays the relationship between digital input code (DAC) and linearity errors, with DAC values ranging from 0 to 5 and corresponding error values ranging from -0.5 to 0.75. There are six DAC values on the x-axis and five error values on the y-axis, indicating a scatter plot of DAC against error. The graph also includes text that provides information about the relationship between DAC and linearity errors in a clear and concise manner.",
