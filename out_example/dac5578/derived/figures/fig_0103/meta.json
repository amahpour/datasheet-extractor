The graph displays four lines, each representing a different channel of digital input code. The first line represents DAC channels A, B, C, and D, while the second line represents DAC channels E, F, G, and H. The third line represents ADC channels A, B, C, and D, and the fourth line represents ADC channels E, F, G, and H. Each line has a different color to distinguish between them.",
