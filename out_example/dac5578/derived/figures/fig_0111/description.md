The image presents a graph with the x-axis labeled "Digital input code" and the y-axis labeled "Differential linearity error". The graph displays the relationship between the digital input code (DAC) and the differential linearity error, represented by a purple line on the graph.

There are five distinct points on the graph, each representing a different DAC value: 0.0, 0.15, 0.25, 0.45, 0.6, 0.82, 1.0, 0.99, and 0.92. These values represent the DAC codes for the first four channels shown in the image. The x-axis is labeled with numbers to indicate the DAC code, while the y-axis shows the corresponding linearity error.
