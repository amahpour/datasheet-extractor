        "text": "The image presents a graph with the x-axis labeled \"Digital input code\" and the y-axis labeled \"Differential linearity error\". The graph displays the relationship between digital input code (DAC) and the differential linearity error, with DAC values ranging from 0 to 40 and corresponding errors ranging from -40 to 40.\n\nThe graph shows a line that connects the data points representing different DAC values and their respective errors. This visual representation helps in understanding how changes in DAC can affect the linearity error in an electronic system.",
