The image presents a graph with two lines, one representing the DC current and the other representing the AC voltage. The DC current line is at 0V on the x-axis and slopes upwards to 1A on the y-axis, while the AC voltage line is at 0V on the x-axis and slopes downwards to 2.5V on the y-axis. A legend indicates that the DC current is measured in amperes (A), and the AC voltage is measured in volts (V). The graph shows a relationship between these two quantities, with the DC current being greater than the AC voltage at all points.
