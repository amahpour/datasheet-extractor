The image presents a black and white diagram that illustrates the relationship between falling edge, trigger pulse, and time. The diagram is divided into three sections, each representing a different component of the electronic device. The falling edge section shows how the falling edge of a trigger pulse changes over time. The trigger pulse section displays the changing values of the trigger pulse as it varies with time.

The figure 42 in the image provides additional information about the relationship between these components and their respective values at a specific moment, likely during an experiment or data collection process.
