        "text": "The image presents a line graph that displays the relationship between temperature and voltage in a series of electronic devices, with each device represented by a different color on the x-axis. The y-axis shows the corresponding voltage values for each device. The graph is labeled \"External Reference = 5V\" at the top, indicating the reference value used to convert the voltage units. The graph also includes a legend that explains the colors and their corresponding voltage values.",
