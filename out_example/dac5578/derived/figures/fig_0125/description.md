The image presents a graph that displays the relationship between power supply current and temperature, with two lines on the graph representing the power supply current (in amps) and the corresponding temperature (in degrees Celsius). The x-axis of the graph is labeled "Power Supply Current" in volts, while the y-axis is labeled "Temperature" in degrees Celsius.

The graph shows that as the power supply current increases, so does the temperature. This relationship can be represented by a positive slope on the graph, indicating an increase in temperature with each unit of increase in power supply current. The graph also includes a legend and a table to provide additional information about the data points.
