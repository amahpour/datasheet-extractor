The image presents a graph with two lines, one representing the external reference and the other indicating the current temperature of a power supply. The graph is colored in blue for the reference line and red for the temperature line. The x-axis displays the units "External Reference" and "Temperature (°C)", while the y-axis shows the units "External Reference" and "Power Supply". The graph indicates that the external reference is 2.5V, and the current temperature of the power supply is 2.8V.
