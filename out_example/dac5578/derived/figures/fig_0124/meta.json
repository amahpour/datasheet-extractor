The graph is colored in blue for the reference line and red for the temperature line. The x-axis displays the units \"External Reference\" and \"Temperature (°C)\", while the y-axis shows the units \"External Reference\" and \"Power Supply\". The graph indicates that the external reference is 2.5V, and the current temperature of the power supply is 2.8V.",
