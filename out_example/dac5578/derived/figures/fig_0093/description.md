The image presents a line graph with the x-axis labeled "Digital input code" and the y-axis labeled "Linearity error". The graph displays four lines, each representing a different digital input code (DAC7778, ADC7778, ADC7779, ADC7780). The data points on the graph show that the DAC7778 and ADC7778 codes are not aligned correctly.
