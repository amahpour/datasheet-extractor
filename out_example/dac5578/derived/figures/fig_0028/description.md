The image presents a graph with the x-axis labeled "Digital input code" and the y-axis labeled "Linearity error". The graph displays six channels, each represented by a different color - purple, green, blue, orange, pink, and yellow. The channels are shown in a line graph format, with their respective values marked on the y-axis against the x-axis. The graph also includes text that provides information about the channels' linearity errors and their corresponding digital input codes.
