The image presents a black and white line graph that displays the relationship between two variables, with each variable represented by a different color on the x and y axes respectively. The x-axis is labeled "Falling Edge" in black text, while the y-axis is labeled "Edge" in black text. The graph shows a downward trend from Code CO06 to 400 h, indicating that the falling edge of an electronic device is decreasing over time.
