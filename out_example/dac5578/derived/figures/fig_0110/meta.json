The graph displays four lines, each representing a different channel of digital input code. The first line represents DAC channel 1, the second line represents DAC channel 2, the third line represents DAC channel 3, and the fourth line represents DAC channel 4.\n\nThe graph also includes text that provides information about the channels and their respective error codes. Specifically, it states \"All eight channels shown are external reference\" and \"External reference = 2.5V\".",
