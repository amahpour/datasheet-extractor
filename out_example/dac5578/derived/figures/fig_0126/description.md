The image presents a graph with the x-axis labeled "External Reference" and the y-axis labeled "Temperature (°C)". The graph displays four lines, each representing a different temperature range in degrees Celsius. The first line represents 0 to 2.5V, the second line represents 2.5 to 5V, the third line represents 5 to 10V, and the fourth line represents 10 to 25V. The graph also includes text that reads "Gain error vs Temperature" and "External reference = 2.5V".
