The image presents a graph with the x-axis labeled "Digital input code" and the y-axis labeled "Differential linearity error". The graph displays the relationship between the digital input code (DAC) and the differential linearity error, represented by a purple line on the graph. The x-axis shows the DAC values from 0 to 40, while the y-axis represents the corresponding errors in percentage terms.

The graph also includes text that provides information about the relationship between DAC and digital input code, as well as the external reference for this relationship.
