The graph displays the relationship between digital input code (DAC) and linearity errors, with DAC codes ranging from 0 to 6 and corresponding error values ranging from -0.5 to 0.5. There are four DAC codes shown on the graph: DAC A, DAC B, DAC C, and DAC E. The graph also includes a legend that explains the relationship between DAC codes and linearity errors.",
