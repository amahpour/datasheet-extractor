The graph displays four channels, each represented by a different color - purple, green, orange, and blue. The channels are shown as varying shades of purple, indicating their respective values on the digital input code. The graph also includes text that provides information about the channels' values and the reference value for the channel's linearity error.\n\nThe image is labeled with a title \"Digital input code vs. Digital input code\" at the top, and it is accompanied by a legend that explains the colors used to represent each channel on the graph.",
