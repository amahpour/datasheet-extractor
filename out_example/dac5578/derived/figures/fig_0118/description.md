# fig_0118

The image presents a graph with two lines, one representing the error in linearity and the other showing the temperature of the device. The x-axis displays the values 0.15 to 0.55, while the y-axis ranges from -0.5 to 0.75. The graph is color-coded, with green representing the maximum value for the INL-MIN line and blue representing the maximum value for the linearity error line.
