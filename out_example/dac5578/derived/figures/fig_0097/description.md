The image presents a graph with two lines, one representing the differential linearity error and the other showing the digital input code. The graph is color-coded to distinguish between the two lines. The x-axis of the graph displays the channels, while the y-axis represents the errors or differences in the channels.

The graph shows that all eight channels are shown on the external reference, with a value of 2.5V for each channel. Additionally, there is a legend indicating that the error values represent the channels' respective errors. The x and y axes display the errors in bits, with the x-axis labeled "CH" and the y-axis labeled "bits."
