        "text": "The image presents a graph with two lines, one representing the external reference and the other representing the temperature. The graph is set against a white background, making it easy to differentiate between the two lines. The x-axis of the graph displays the values 0.15 and 0.25, while the y-axis shows 0.05 and 0.26. The graph illustrates that there are differences in the external reference and temperature, with one line being higher than the other.",
