        "text": "The image presents a graph with two lines, one representing the differential linearity error and the other showing the digital input code (DAC). The graph is color-coded to distinguish between the two lines. The x-axis of the graph displays the channels shown by the external reference, while the y-axis represents the DAC codes for each channel. The graph shows that all eight channels are shown in the external reference and that the DAC codes match those displayed on the graph.\n\nThe image also includes a legend to explain the color-coding of the lines representing the differential linearity error and digital input code, as well as a table with DAC codes for each channel.",
