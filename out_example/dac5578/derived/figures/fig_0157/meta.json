        "text": "The image presents a black and white diagram of an electronic device, with the device's functionality labeled in black text against a white background. The device is designed to measure external reference values, such as voltage or current, using a trigger pulse method. The diagram also includes a legend that explains the different components of the device, including the trigger pulse, LDAAC clock feed-through, and external reference.\n\nThe diagram features a time scale on the left side, with the units \"time (2ps/d)\" indicating the duration for which the device is measuring the values. The device's functionality is clearly labeled in black text against a white background, making it easy to understand its purpose and operation.",
