The image presents a graph with two lines, one representing the differential linearity error and the other representing the digital input code (DAC). The graph is color-coded to indicate different channels of the ADC. The x-axis represents the channels, while the y-axis shows the DAC channels. The graph displays the relationship between these channels, providing a visual representation of how they are connected in an electronic device.
