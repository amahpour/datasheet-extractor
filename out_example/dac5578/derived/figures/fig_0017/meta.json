        "text": "The image presents a graph that displays the relationship between linearity error and digital input code (DAC) for eight channels shown on an external reference. The x-axis of the graph represents DAC, while the y-axis shows linearity error in bits. The graph is divided into four quadrants, each representing one channel from 0 to 40 bits. The data points are represented by dots connected by lines, and a legend indicates that all eight channels shown on the external reference have an external reference value of 5V.",
