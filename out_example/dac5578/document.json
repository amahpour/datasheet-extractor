The devices are monolithic, provide good linearity,and minimize undesired code-to-code transient voltages (glitch).\nThe devices use a versatile, 2-wire serial interface that is I 2 C-compatible and operates at clock rates of up to 3.4MHz. Multiple devices can share the same bus.\nThe devices incorporate a power-on-reset (POR) circuit that ensures the DAC output powers up to zero-scale or midscale until a valid code is written to the device. These devices also contain a power-down feature, accessed through the serial interface, that reduces the current consumption of the devices to typically 0.42 μ A at 5V. Power consumption is typically 2.32mW at 3V, reducing to 0.68 μ W in power-down mode. The low power consumption and small footprint make these devices ideal for portable, battery-operated equipment.",
