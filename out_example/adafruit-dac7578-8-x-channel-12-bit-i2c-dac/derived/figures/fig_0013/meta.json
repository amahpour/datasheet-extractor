The circuit board is divided into multiple tabs, each representing a different feature or function. The first tab displays the text \"circuitpy\" and its corresponding icon, while the second tab shows the text \"circuitsd\" and an icon depicting a circuit board. The third tab features the text \"metadatatest\" and an icon of a circuit board with multiple components. The fourth tab contains the text \"thisfunkt\" and an icon representing a circuit board component, such as a switch or resistor. The fifth tab displays the text \"trash\" and an icon for a trash bin on the circuit board.",
