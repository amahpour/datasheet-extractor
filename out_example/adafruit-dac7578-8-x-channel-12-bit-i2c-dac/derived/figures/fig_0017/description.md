The image shows a computer screen displaying a page from an electronics datasheet for Arduino. The page is titled "VerifyCompile" and has a list of options, including "Show Sketch Folder", "Include Library", and "Add File". The text on the page suggests that the user can use this software to create and manage their own projects using Arduino programming language.

The screen also features a code editor window with an open file named "codeeditor.py" in the left corner, which is likely used for writing and testing code.
