        "text": "The image presents a circuit board with various electronic components, including a black and white ADC (Digital Accelerometer) connected to the board by wires. The ADC is part of a larger circuit that includes a microcontroller, a battery pack, and other components. The circuit board is placed on top of a white background, making it easy to read and understand the layout of the electronic components.",
