The graph displays the relationship between the digital input code (DAC) and the differential linearity error, represented by the number of channels shown on the external reference.\n\nThere are six channels visible in the graph, with three channels being shown for DAC57, 10-bit, and 40-bit inputs. The x-axis shows the DAC input codes, while the y-axis displays the corresponding differential linearity errors.",
