The graph is colored in black and white, providing a clear visual representation of the data. The graph displays two lines on the same page, one labeled \"clock feedthrough\" and the other labeled \"clock feedthrough impuse\". These labels are accompanied by arrows pointing to the respective lines, further emphasizing their relationship within the circuit.",
