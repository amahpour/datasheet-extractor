The x-axis displays the units \"External Reference\" in mV/cm, while the y-axis shows the units \"Temperature (°C)\" in degrees Celsius. The graph is colored blue for the reference line and black for the temperature line, creating a clear visual representation of the relationship between these two factors.",
