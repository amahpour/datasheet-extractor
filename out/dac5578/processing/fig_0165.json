  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a detailed circuit diagram for a low-pass filter, specifically designed to pass signals with a frequency range of 2x10^3 to 10x10^3 Hertz (Hz). The filter is composed of three sections, each represented by a vertical line and connected by a horizontal line. The top section has two vertical lines, the middle section has one vertical line, and the bottom section also features two vertical lines. Each section is labeled with its corresponding frequency range, indicating that the filter will pass signals within this frequency range.",
