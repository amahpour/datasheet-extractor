The graph displays the relationship between digital input code (DAC) and linearity errors, with DAC values ranging from 0 to 40 bits. There are four lines on the graph representing different DAC values: 0, 5, 10, and 15 bits. Each line represents a DAC value, and the corresponding linearity error is shown in the y-axis. The graph also includes text that provides information about DAC channels and their external reference.",
