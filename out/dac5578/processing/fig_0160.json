  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a black and white diagram that illustrates the external reference of a trigger pulse, which is used to feed data through a LDAAC clock. The diagram shows the trigger pulse's voltage and current values over time, with the x-axis representing time in seconds and the y-axis indicating the voltage or current in millivolts (mV). The diagram also includes labels for the trigger pulse, external reference, and feed-through.",
