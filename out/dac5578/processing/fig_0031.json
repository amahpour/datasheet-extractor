  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a graph with two lines, one representing the differential linearity error and the other showing the digital input code (DAC). The graph is color-coded to distinguish between the two lines. The x-axis of the graph displays the DAC codes, while the y-axis represents the linearity error in dB.\n\nThe graph shows that all eight channels shown on the external reference are shown correctly, with a linearity error of 0.5 dB. This information is crucial for understanding the performance and accuracy of the digital input code used to process the data.",
