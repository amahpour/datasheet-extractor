The graph displays the relationship between digital input code (DAC) and linear error, with DAC values ranging from 0 to 1 on the x-axis and corresponding linear errors ranging from -0.5 to 0.5 on the y-axis. There are multiple data points representing different DAC values, each connected by a line. The graph also includes text that provides information about the relationship between DAC and linear error, as well as the units of measurement for both axes.",
