  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a graph that displays the relationship between voltage and current in a circuit, with the x-axis representing voltage and the y-axis representing current. The graph shows a downward trend, indicating that as the voltage increases, so does the current flowing through the circuit. There is also an equation present on the graph, which suggests that the source current at positive rail can be calculated using the equation: Current (mA) = Voltage (V) / Resistance (Ω).",
