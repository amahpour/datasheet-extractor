  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a graph with the x-axis labeled \"Channel B\" and the y-axis labeled \"DC Loaded with 0h External Reference = 2.5V\". The graph shows a line that slopes upwards, indicating a positive relationship between Channel B and DC Loaded with 0h. The slope of the line is 2.5V/0h, which means that for every unit increase in channel B, there is an increase of 2.5V in the DC Loaded value.",
