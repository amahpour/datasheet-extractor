  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a black and white diagram of a circuit, with the words \"DAC Unloaded\" written in the top left corner. The circuit is connected to a power supply labeled \"V2 mViv\", which indicates that it operates at 2 mViv voltage. A graph is displayed below the circuit, showing the relationship between time (in seconds) and current (in amperes). The x-axis of the graph represents time in seconds, while the y-axis represents the current flowing through the circuit.",
