The graph displays four channels, each represented by a different color - red, green, blue, and purple. The channels are shown as varying linearly across the x-axis, indicating that they have been processed at different stages of digital transformation.\n\nThe graph also includes text that provides information about the linear error in terms of \"All eight channels shown\", \"External reference = 5V\", and \"12 bit + 125\" for each channel.",
