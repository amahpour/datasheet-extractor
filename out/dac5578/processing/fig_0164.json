  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a black and white circuit diagram that illustrates the components of a DC amplifier. The diagram includes resistors, capacitors, and a voltage divider connected in series to form the amplifier. The resistors are arranged in parallel with their resistances shown as numbers on the diagram. A voltage divider is also present, which is used to control the input voltage for the amplifier.\n\nThe circuit diagram shows that there are multiple resistors connected together, and a voltage divider is included among them. This combination of components allows for precise control over the input voltage in the DC amplifier.",
