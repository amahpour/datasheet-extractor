  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a black and white line graph that displays the relationship between voltage (V) and current (I). The x-axis of the graph represents time, while the y-axis shows the measured values in amperes. The graph is divided into four quadrants, each representing a different range of voltage levels: 0V to 5V, 5V to 10V, 10V to 15V, and 15V to 25V. The data points on the graph are connected by lines, showing the relationship between the two variables over time.",
