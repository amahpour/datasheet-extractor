The graph displays the relationship between digital input code (DAC) and linearity errors, with DAC codes ranging from 0 to 6 and corresponding error values ranging from -0.5 to 0.5. There are four DAC codes on the x-axis and five error values on the y-axis, indicating a scatter plot of DAC codes against their respective errors. The graph also includes text that explains the relationship between DAC input code and linearity errors in terms of external reference and digital input code.",
