  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a graph that displays the relationship between linearity error and digital input code (DAC) for a specific electronic device, likely a computer or audio system. The x-axis of the graph represents DAC, while the y-axis shows linearity error in percentage. The graph is divided into four quadrants, each representing a different DAC value: 0-2V, 2-4V, 4-8V, and 8-16V. Each quadrant displays the corresponding linearity error for that specific DAC value.",
