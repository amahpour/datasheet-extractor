  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a graph that displays the relationship between current and voltage in a circuit, with the x-axis representing current (in amperes) and the y-axis representing voltage (in volts). The graph shows a downward trend, indicating that as current increases, so does the voltage. There is also a line of best fit on the graph, which suggests an equation to describe this relationship between current and voltage in the circuit.",
