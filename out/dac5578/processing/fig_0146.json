The diagram shows a rise in voltage over time, indicating that the sensor is detecting changes in electrical current or power. The text at the bottom of the diagram provides information about the sensor's functionality, stating that it measures the rise/falling edge of an external reference signal and can be used for various applications such as measuring the temperature of a room or monitoring the flow rate of water through pipes.",
