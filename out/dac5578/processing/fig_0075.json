  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a graph with two lines, one labeled \"Power-on Glitch\" and the other labeled \"Reset-to-mid Scale\". The graph displays voltage values for both the power-on glitch and the mid-scale settings of a device. The x-axis represents time in seconds, while the y-axis represents voltage in volts.\n\nThe graph shows that the device operates at a higher voltage during the power-on glitch setting compared to the mid-scale setting. This information can be useful for understanding how the device performs under different conditions and may help troubleshoot any issues related to its operation.",
