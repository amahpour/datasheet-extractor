  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a graph that displays the relationship between power supply current and temperature for various external reference values of 2.5V, 3.0V, and 2.7V. The x-axis represents the power supply current in amperes (A), while the y-axis represents the temperature in degrees Celsius (°C). The graph shows a clear trend: as the power supply current increases, so does the temperature. This relationship is depicted by a line on the graph that slopes upwards from left to right, indicating an increase in temperature with each unit of current.",
