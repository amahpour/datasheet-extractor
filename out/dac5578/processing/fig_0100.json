The graph displays four lines, each representing a different digital input code. The first line is labeled \"DAC7778\", the second line is labeled \"DAC7778, 12 bit + 25°C\", the third line is labeled \"DAC7778, 12 bit - 25°C\", and the fourth line is labeled \"DAC7778, 12 bit + 35°C\". The graph shows that there are differences in linearity between these four lines.",
