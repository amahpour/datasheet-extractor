The x-axis of the graph is labeled \"External Reference\", while the y-axis is labeled \"Temperature (DAC5778)\". The graph shows that the external reference is 5V, which is the maximum value for the linear error.\n\nThe graph also includes a legend indicating that the line representing the linear error is represented by the color green and the line representing temperature is represented by the color blue.",
