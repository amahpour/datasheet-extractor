The graph displays the relationship between digital input code (DAC) and Linearity error, with DAC values ranging from 0 to 1 on the x-axis and corresponding Linearity errors ranging from -0.5 to 0.5 on the y-axis. There are four distinct points on the graph representing different DAC values and their corresponding Linearity errors. The graph also includes a legend that explains the relationship between DAC and Linearity error, stating \"All eight channels shown have an external reference of 2.5V\".",
