  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a graph with the x-axis labeled \"Digital input code\" and the y-axis labeled \"Differential linearity error\". The graph displays the relationship between the digital input code (DAC) and the differential linearity error, represented by the number of channels shown on the graph.\n\nThere are six distinct channels visible in the graph, with each channel corresponding to a different DAC value. The x-axis shows the DAC values from 0 to 10 bits, while the y-axis represents the linearity error in percentage terms. The graph clearly illustrates that as the DAC increases, the linearity error also increases, indicating a negative relationship between these two variables.",
