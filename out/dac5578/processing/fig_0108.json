  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a graph with two lines, one representing the differential linearity error and the other showing the digital input code (DAC) for a digital input device. The graph is color-coded to indicate different channels of the ADC. The x-axis displays the DAC codes, while the y-axis represents the linearity error in dBm. The graph shows that all eight channels shown on the external reference are shown correctly, with an error of 0.2dBm.",
