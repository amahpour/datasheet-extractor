The x-axis is labeled \"External Reference\", while the y-axis is labeled \"Maximum Temperature (DC78)\". The graph shows that the maximum temperature of the device is higher than the external reference value.\n\nThe graph also includes text at the top, which reads \"DIFFERENTIAL LINEARITY ERROR vs Temperature (DC77), 12-bit\", and a legend below it stating \"DNL MIN\" and \"DNL MAX\".",
