  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a graph with two lines, one representing the external reference and the other indicating the current temperature of a power supply. The graph is color-coded to distinguish between the two lines. The x-axis displays the reference value in millivolts (mV), while the y-axis represents the current temperature in degrees Celsius (°C). The graph shows that the external reference and the current temperature are not equal, indicating a difference or variation in their values.",
