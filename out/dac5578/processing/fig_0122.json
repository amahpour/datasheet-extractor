  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a graph with two lines, one representing the linear error and the other representing the temperature. The x-axis of the graph is labeled \"External Reference\", while the y-axis is labeled \"Temperature (DC57)\". The graph shows that there are two errors in the external reference, which could be due to different factors such as temperature or measurement technique.\n\nThe graph also includes a legend indicating that the error on the x-axis represents the temperature and the error on the y-axis represents the linear error. This information helps viewers understand the relationship between the two variables being measured in the experiment.",
