The graph displays the relationship between the digital input code (DAC) and the differential linearity error, represented by a purple line on the graph. The x-axis shows the DAC values from 0 to 8 bits, while the y-axis represents the corresponding errors in linearity. The graph is labeled with text that provides information about the relationship between the two variables.",
