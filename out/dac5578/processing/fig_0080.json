  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a black and white line graph that displays the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in a circuit. The x-axis of the graph represents time (in seconds), while the y-axis represents the measured values of voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R). The graph shows an increase in voltage over time, indicating a rise in the circuit's potential energy. The line connecting the data points on the graph is steep, suggesting a strong relationship between the variables.",
