The x-axis of the graph represents DAC, while the y-axis shows linearity error in bits. The graph is color-coded to indicate different channels, with each channel represented by a distinct color. The graph also includes text that provides information about the relationship between linearity error and digital input code for eight channels shown on an external reference.",
