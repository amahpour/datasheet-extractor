The Adafruit DACx578 Breakouts are the answer to your wishes! Within its little package, the DACx578 has eight DACs for whatever voltage setting needs you may have, easily controlled over I2C.\n\nstemmall\n\n0 • • • • • • • •\n\nADO\n\nDAC7578\n\n12C Octal 12bit DAC\n\nDefault 12C Addr 0x4C\n\nBroadcast Address 0x47\n\nVLogic/Vcc: 3-5VDC\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nN0000\n\nThe DACx578 can easily work with 3.3V or 5V power and logic so no matter what microcontroller / microcomputer you're using, you'll get full range output. Note that this DAC is 'ratiometric' - that means that 0 is ground and 4095 is whatever the Vref voltage is. By default the Vref is tied to the power pin, but you could cut a jumper to set the top voltage to anything between 0 and the power pin. E.g. if you want a precision 4.095V reference, you'll need to power with 5V, and provide 4.095V on the VRef pin.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe breakout for the DACx578 is populated with the required support circuitry to use it with your microcontroller of choice or Blinka-supported computer. The SparkFun Qwiic (https://adafru.it/Fpw) compatible STEMMA QT (https://adafru.it/Ft4) JST SH connectors ease the process of connecting the DACx578 to your project and allows\n\nVRf O\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\n7 GND\n\nO\n\nyou to easily share an I2C bus with other STEMMA QT, Qwiic, Grove, or other compatible sensors.

The pinout is the same for both.\n\n## Power Pins\n\n- VCC - this is the power pin. To power the board, give it the same power as the logic level of your microcontroller - e.g. for a 5V micro like Arduino, use 5V. ·\n- Vrf Jumper - this is the reference voltage jumper. It is located on the front of the board, to the left of the DACx578 chip. If you cut this jumper, the VRf pin is disconnected from VCC and can be connected to to any voltage between 0 and the VCC voltage level. For example, if you want a precision 4.095V reference, you'll need to cut the Vrf jumper , power with 5V to VCC , and provide 4.095V on the VRf pin. ·\n- VRf - this is the reference voltage pin. By default, it is tied to VCC and as a result will share the same voltage level. ·\n- GND - common ground for power and logic ·\n\n## I2C Logic Pins\n\n- SCL - I2C clock pin, connect to your microcontroller's I2C clock line. This pin can use 3-5V logic, and there's a 10K pullup on this pin. ·\n- STEMMA QT (https://adafru.it/Ft4) These connectors allow you to connect to dev boards with STEMMA QT (qwiic) connectors or to other things with various associated accessories (https://adafru.it/Ft6) ·\n- SDA - I2C data pin, connect to your microcontroller's I2C data line. This pin can use 3-5V logic, and there's a 10K pullup on this pin. ·\n\n## DAC Output Pins\n\nAlong the top edge of the board are the DAC output pins. They are labeled 0 -7 . Each pin is connected to one of the eight channel outputs from the DACx578.\n\n## Other Pins\n\n- LDAC - This is the load DAC pin. LDAC is used for synchronous or asynchronous updating of the DAC outputs. According to the datasheet, you should be able to toggle this pin to send the buffer to the output pins after using the write only command. However, in testing, this pin has not worked as described. ·\n- CLR - This is the clear pin. It clears all DAC registers and buffers, replacing them with the value stored in the clear code register. The register can be set to zeroscale, mid-scale, full-scale, or disabled. The default setting of the clear code register sets the output of all DAC channels to 0V when the CLR pin is brought low. ·\n\nADDR\n\nADO\n\nIn testing, the LDAC pin has not worked as described in the datasheet. Its believed to be a silicon bug in the DACx578.\n\n## I2C Address Jumper\n\nOn the back of the board is a three section jumper labeled AD0 , directly above the DACx578 label on the board silk. This jumper allow you to chain up to 3 of these boards on the same pair of I2C clock and data pins. To do so, you solder the jumpers \"closed\" by connecting the two pads.\n\nThe default I2C address is 0x4C . This address is set by leaving the address pin floating. None of the jumper pads soldered closed.\n\nIf you solder the center jumper pad to the pad to its left, you connect the address pin to GND and set the I2C address to 0x48 .\n\nIf you solder the center jumper pad to the pad to its right, you connect the address pin to VCC and set the I2C address to 0x4A .\n\nThe table below shows all possible addresses and the jumper positions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Power LED and LED Jumper\n\n- Power LED In the upper left corner, above the STEMMA connector, on the front of the board, is the power LED, labeled on . It is a green LED. ·\n\nDAC\n\nSignal\n\n- LED jumper - This jumper, labeled LED on the board silk, is located on the back of the board, on the right. Cut the trace on this jumper to cut power to the \"on\" LED. ·\n\n## Broadcast Addressing\n\nThe DACx578 chips support broadcast addressing. This means that you can update DACx578 devices synchronously. This only supports write mode, you cannot perform reads with it. The broadcast address is 0x47 .\n\n## CircuitPython and Python\n\nIt's easy to use the DACx578 with Python or CircuitPython, and the Adafruit\\_CircuitPython\\_x578 (https://adafru.it/1aeQ) module. This module allows you to easily write Python code to write data to the DAC outputs.\n\nYou can use this driver with any CircuitPython microcontroller board or with a computer that has GPIO and Python thanks to Adafruit\\_Blinka, our CircuitPython-forPython compatibility library (https://adafru.it/BSN).\n\n## CircuitPython Microcontroller Wiring\n\nFirst wire up the DAC to your board exactly as follows. The following is the DAC wired to a Feather RP2040 using the STEMMA connector:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBoard STEMMA 3V to DAC VCC (red wire) Board STEMMA GND to DAC GND (black wire) Board STEMMA SCL to DAC SCL (yellow wire) Board STEMMA SDA to DAC SDA (blue\n\nDAC channels.\n\nwire) You can output a signal from any of the 8\n\nThe following is the DAC wired to a Feather RP2040 using a solderless breadboard:\n\nHDMI\n\nHDMI\n\nVU\n\nDAC\n\nDAC\n\nDAC\n\nSignal\n\nSignal\n\nOutput\n\nSignal\n\nOutput\n\nOutput\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEVV\n\n## Python Computer Wiring\n\nSince there are dozens of Linux computers/boards you can use, we will show wiring for Raspberry Pi.

This may also require enabling I2C on your platform and verifying you are running Python 3. Since each platform is a little different, and Linux changes often, please visit the CircuitPython on Linux guide to get your computer ready (https://adafru.it/BSN)!\n\nOnce that's done, from your command line run the following command:\n\n- pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-dacx578 ·\n\nIf your default Python is version 3 you may need to run 'pip' instead. Just make sure you aren't trying to use CircuitPython on Python 2.x, it isn't supported!\n\n## CircuitPython Usage\n\nTo use with CircuitPython, you need to first install the Adafruit\\_CircuitPython\\_DACx578 library, and its dependencies, into the lib folder on your CIRCUITPY drive. Then you need to update code.py with the example script.\n\nThankfully, we can do this in one go. In the example below, click the Download Project Bundle button below to download the necessary libraries and the code.py file in a zip file. Extract the contents of the zip file, and copy the entire lib folder and the code.py file to your CIRCUITPY drive.\n\nYour CIRCUITPY/lib folder should contain the following folder and file:\n\n- adafruit\\_bus\\_device/ ·\n- adafruit\\_dacx578.mpy ·\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Python Usage\n\nOnce you have the library pip3 installed on your computer, copy or download the following example to your computer, and run the following, replacing code.py with whatever you named the file:\n\n## python3 code.py\n\n## Example Code\n\nIf running CircuitPython: Once everything is saved to the CIRCUITPY drive, connect to the serial console (https://adafru.it/Bec) to see the data printed out!\n\nIf running Python: The console output will appear wherever you are running Python.\n\n```\n# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright (c) 2025 Liz Clark for Adafruit Industries # # SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT import math import time import board import adafruit_dacx578 # Initialize I2C and DAC i2c = board.I2C() dac = adafruit_dacx578.DACx578(i2c) MAX_VALUE = 65535 # 16-bit value BASE_FREQ = 1.0 # frequency in Hz SAMPLE_RATE = 100 # samples per second FREQ_MULTIPLIERS = [ 1.0, # Channel 0: 1 Hz 2.0, # Channel 1: 2 Hz 3.0, # Channel 2: 3 Hz 4.0, # Channel 3: 4 Hz 5.0, # Channel 4: 5 Hz 6.0, # Channel 5: 6 Hz 7.0, # Channel 6: 7 Hz 8.0, # Channel 7: 8 Hz ] def calculate_sinewave(frequency, time_point): angle = 2 * math.pi * frequency * time_point return int((math.sin(angle) + 1) * (MAX_VALUE / 2)) start_time = time.monotonic() while True: current_time = time.monotonic() -start_time for channel_num in range(8): frequency = BASE_FREQ * FREQ_MULTIPLIERS[channel_num] value = calculate_sinewave(frequency, current_time) dac.channels[channel_num].value = value time.sleep(1 / SAMPLE_RATE)\n```\n\nRIGOL\n\nHorizontal\n\n+Width\n\n-Width\n\nFreq\n\n1\n\nstit\n\n1\n\n500mv\n\nT'D\n\nH\n\n200ms\n\nAvg: 1.00 Hz\n\nUtility\n\n0\n\n2.48 V\n\nKeyLock\n\nFirst, the DAC is instantiated over I2C.
