The graph displays the relationship between the digital input code (DAC) and the differential linearity error, represented by a purple line on the graph.\n\nThere are six distinct points on the graph, each representing a different DAC value: 0.0, 0.25, 0.45, 0.55, 0.82, 1.0. The x-coordinate of each point is labeled with the DAC value it corresponds to, and the y-coordinate shows the corresponding differential linearity error.",
