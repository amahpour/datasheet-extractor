  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a graph that displays the power-supply current of a device over time, with the x-axis representing time and the y-axis representing the current in milliampere-hours (mA). The graph shows a steady increase in power consumption as time progresses, indicating that the device is drawing more power as it operates.\n\nThe graph also includes a legend that provides information about the units of measurement used for the x and y axes. In this case, the x-axis measures time in hours, while the y-axis measures current in milliampere-hours (mA). The legend indicates that the current is measured in mA.",
