  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a graph that displays the rise and fall of a signal over time, with a range of values ranging from 0 to 5us/div. The x-axis represents time in hours, while the y-axis shows the voltage or power level of the signal. The graph is color-coded for clarity, with different colors representing different ranges of voltage levels. The rise and fall of the signal are depicted by a series of peaks and valleys on the graph, indicating changes in the signal's power over time.",
