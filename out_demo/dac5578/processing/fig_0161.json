  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a black and white diagram of an electronic device, with the x-axis labeled \"External Reference\" and the y-axis labeled \"Voltage (V)\" and \"Current (mA)\". The diagram shows a graph of the device's output voltage over time, indicating that it is in operation.\n\nThe device has three main components: an external reference input, an ADC (Digital Amplitude Change Detection) trigger pulse input, and an LDC (External Reference Clock) feed-through input. These inputs are connected to the device through wires, with a line connecting them at the bottom of the diagram. The device is shown in operation, as indicated by the black lines on the graph representing the voltage and current over time.",
