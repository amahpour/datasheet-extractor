The graph is labeled \"DIFFERENTIAL LINARITY ERROR vs Temperature (DAC5578 8-bit)\" in black text at the top of the page. The x-axis shows the temperature values from 0 to 10 degrees Celsius, while the y-axis represents the external reference and the temperature. The graph displays two lines: one line representing the external reference and another line representing the temperature. The temperature is represented by a green line on the right side of the image, while the external reference is shown as a blue line above it.",
