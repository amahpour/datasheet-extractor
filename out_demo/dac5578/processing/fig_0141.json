  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a graph with two lines, one representing the DC current and the other representing the AC voltage. The DC current line is at 0V, while the AC voltage line is at 2V. A legend indicates that the DC current is measured in milliampere-hours (mAh), and the AC voltage is measured in volts (V). The graph also includes a table with two columns: one for the DC current and another for the AC voltage.",
