The graph displays the relationship between the digital input code (DAC) and the differential linearity error, represented by a purple line on the graph. The x-axis shows the DAC values from 0 to 40, while the y-axis represents the corresponding errors in linearity.\n\nThe graph also includes text that explains the relationship between the DAC and the linearity error, stating \"All eight channels shown are external reference + 5V\".",
