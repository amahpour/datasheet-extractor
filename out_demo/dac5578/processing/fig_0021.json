  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a graph with two lines, one representing the error in digital input code and the other showing the difference between the expected and actual channels. The x-axis of the graph is labeled \"Digital input code\" while the y-axis is labeled \"External reference\". The graph displays four channels on the x-axis and six channels on the y-axis, with a purple line representing the error in digital input code and a green line showing the difference between the expected and actual channels.\n\nThe text at the top of the image reads \"Differential linearity error vs. Digital input code DAC7718, 12 bit + 25 degrees C\", indicating that the graph is comparing two different aspects related to electronic systems or devices.",
