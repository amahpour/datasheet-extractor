  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a graph that displays the relationship between voltage and current in a DC circuit, specifically focusing on the source current at a positive rail. The x-axis of the graph represents the voltage, while the y-axis represents the current. A line is drawn connecting two points on the graph, indicating the source current for a channel with an external reference of 2.5V and 2.5A.",
