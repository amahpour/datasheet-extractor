  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a detailed electronic datasheet for a device that measures the rise and fall of an external reference signal, such as an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) or a microcontroller. The device is designed to measure the rise and fall of the reference signal over time, providing valuable information about its behavior. The datasheet includes a diagram showing the device's internal components and their respective functions, along with a table listing the device's specifications and performance characteristics.\n\nThe rise and fall of the reference signal are represented by two lines on the graph, which vary in height to indicate changes in the signal over time. The device is designed to measure these variations accurately, providing precise data about the signal's behavior.",
