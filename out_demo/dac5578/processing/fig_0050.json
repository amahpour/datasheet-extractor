  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a graph with two lines, one representing the external reference and the other indicating the current temperature of a power supply. The graph is color-coded to distinguish between the two lines. The x-axis displays the units \"V\" for voltage, while the y-axis represents the units \"°C\". The graph shows that the current temperature of the power supply is at least 65 degrees Celsius and is below the external reference value of 5 volts.\n\nThe text in the image provides information about the relationship between the two lines on the graph. It states that the current temperature is less than or equal to the external reference, which means that the power supply is functioning properly within a specific range of temperatures.",
