The x-axis is labeled \"External Reference\", while the y-axis is labeled \"Maximum Temperature (DC)\". The graph shows that the maximum temperature of the device is higher than the external reference value.\n\nThe text at the top of the image reads \"DIFFERENTIAL LINARITY ERROR vs Temperature (DCS6810, 10-bit)\", which indicates a comparison between the error in the linearity of an electronic device and its corresponding temperature.",
