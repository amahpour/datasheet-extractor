The x-axis of the graph is labeled \"External Reference\", while the y-axis is labeled \"Temperature (DC5768)\". The graph shows that there are two errors in the linearity, with one being 0.25 and the other being 0.28. These errors indicate a discrepancy between the expected linear relationship and the actual observed relationship.",
