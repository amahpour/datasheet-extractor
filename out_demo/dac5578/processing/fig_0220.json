  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a detailed technical drawing of a soldering iron, with the focus on its components and their dimensions. The drawing is predominantly in black and white, providing clear instructions for assembly or disassembly. The soldering iron features two red bars that are connected by a thin line, indicating the joining of two components. The drawing also includes labels such as \"Solder paste example\" and \"Based on a 3D scan of a soldering iron\", which provide context to the image's content.\n\nThe drawing is accompanied by a list of dimensions for each component, including \"10x15.4mm\", \"16x16.4mm\", \"18x18.4mm\", \"19x18.4mm\", and \"21x18.4mm\". These dimensions are crucial in understanding the soldering iron's size and shape, which is essential information for assembly or disassembly purposes.",
