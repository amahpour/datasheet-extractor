The graph displays four lines, each representing a different temperature range in degrees Celsius. The first line represents 0 to 5 degrees Celsius, the second line represents 6 to 10 degrees Celsius, the third line represents 11 to 15 degrees Celsius, and the fourth line represents 16 to 20 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe graph also includes text that reads \"Gain error vs Temperature\" at the top of the image, indicating a comparison between gain errors and temperature in an electronic device or circuit.",
