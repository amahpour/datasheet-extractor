  "local_llm_description": "The image presents a line graph with two lines, one representing the DC current and the other representing the AC voltage. The DC current is represented by a blue line that slopes upwards to the right, while the AC voltage is depicted by a black line that slopes downwards to the left. Both lines are connected at their respective ends, creating a visual representation of the relationship between the two quantities.\n\nThe graph also includes text that provides information about the DC current and AC voltage in terms of amperes (A) and volts (V), respectively. The text states that the DC current is 0.6 A and the AC voltage is 0.1 V, with a slope of 1/3 for both lines.",
