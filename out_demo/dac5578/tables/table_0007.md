| PACKAGE.16-Pin | PACKAGE.24-PIN | NAME.NAME | DESCRIPTION.DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 22 | LDAC | Load DACs |
| 2 | 11 | ADDR0 | 3-state address input |
| 3 | 2 | AV DD | Power-supply input, 2.7V to 5.5V |
| 4 | 3 | V OUT A | Analog output voltage from DAC A |
| 5 | 4 | V OUT C | Analog output voltage from DAC C |
| 6 | 5 | V OUT E | Analog output voltage from DAC E |
| 7 | 6 | V OUT G | Analog output voltage from DAC G |
| 8 | 8 | V REFIN | Positive reference input |
| 9 | 12 | CLR | Asynchronous clear input |
| 10 | 13 | V OUT H | Analog output voltage from DAC H |
| 11 | 14 | V OUT F | Analog output voltage from DAC F |
| 12 | 15 | V OUT D | Analog output voltage from DAC D |
| 13 | 16 | V OUT B | Analog output voltage from DAC B |
| 14 | 17 | GND | Ground reference point for all circuitry on the device |
| 15 | 19 | SDA | Serial data input. Data are clocked into or out of the input register. This pin is a bidirectional, open- drain data line that should be connected to the supply voltage with an external pull-up resistor. |
| 16 | 20 | SCL | Serial clock input. Data can be transferred at rates up to 3.4MHz. Schmitt-trigger logic input. |
| - | 1 | NC | Not internally connected |
| - | 7 | NC | Not internally connected |
| - | 9 | RSTSEL | Reset select pin. RSTSEL high resets device to mid-scale; RSTSEL low resets device to zero-scale. |
| - | 10 | ADDR1 | 3-state address input |
| - | 18 | NC | Not internally connected |
| - | 21 | TWOC | Twos complement select. If the TWOC pin is pulled high, the DAC registers use twos complement format; if TWOC is pulled low, the DAC registers use straight binary format. |
| - | 23 | NC | Not internally connected |
| - | 24 | NC | Not internally connected |
